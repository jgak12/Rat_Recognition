# Rat_Recognition

# This is our lab-rat recognition software. It is designed to track a rat as it navigates a static environment, as well as collect a variety of information in the process.
It can determine the total distance the rat traveled in a given time frame, display when it was 'frozen' in place, and display plots of both of these statistics.
It will also show a live tracking footage and overlay the rat's previous path as it navigates the environment. 
Nobel Prize pending.
